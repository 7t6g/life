Life
====

This is something that I've wanted to build for a long time. It's a **timeline of important events** in my life, visualized in a way my mind always imagine it. There was something called [**Lifepath.me**](http://dcurt.is/facebook-timelines-and-lifepath-me-4) but now it's gone. How about Facebook timeline? Meh.

So, this is it. Have a look at [cheeaun.github.io/life](http://cheeaun.github.io/life).
